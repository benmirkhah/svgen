# SVGen

<b>Generates SVG files with parametric semi-random shapes defined in configuration.</b>

I love SVG files, specially for page backgrounds, so I made a tool to generate them, <a href="https://github.benmirkhah.com/svgen/">see it in action</a>!

The goal is to add a UI so one can use this software as a tool to:
- A) Generate random SVG backgrounds with various shapes and effects
- B) Generate parametric designs using the included shapes and grids

This is a work in progress, so far it includes random colors, gradients and filters, parametric grids, size, position and rotation, and most importantly...

Random shapes:
- Flowers ( 5 - 15 petals)
- Stars (5 - 15 points)
- Fluffy Clouds
- Circles
- Squares 
- Nautili (nautiluses are NOT A LIE) 
- Triangles
- Pentagons (defense headquarters)
- Hexagons (6 sides)
- Octagons (8 sides)
- Oddagons (random odd numbered sides) 
- Dexagons (10 sides)
- Dozengons (12 sides)
- Randogons (random numbers of sides)
  
More shapes are planned to be added including blobs, flames, hearts, etc.

No UI yet (coming soon) but the granular config object allows fine adjustment of parameters each shape.
