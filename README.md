<b>Generates SVG files with semi-random elements defined by min/max parameters set in the configuration.</b>

I love SVG files, specially for page backgrounds, <a href="https://github.benmirkhah.com/svgen/">see it in action</a>.

This is a work in progress, so far it includes random colors, gradients and filters, and most importantly...

Random sized shapes:
- circles
- squares 
- triangle
- flowers
- clouds
- pentagon (defense headquarters)
- hexagon  (6 sides)
- octagons (8 sides)
- oddagons (random odd numbered sides) 
- dexagons (10 sides)
- randogon (random numbers of sides)
  
More shapes are planned to be added including blobs, mountains, and bearclaws!

No UI yet (coming soon) but the granular config object allows fine adjustment of all parameters used in generating the shapes.
