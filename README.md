# SVGen

<b>Generates SVG files with parametric semi-random elements defined in configuration.</b>

I love SVG files, specially for page backgrounds, so I made a tool to generate them, <a href="https://github.benmirkhah.com/svgen/">see it in action</a>!

This is a work in progress, so far it includes random colors, gradients and filters, parametric size, position and rotation, and most importantly...

Random shapes:
- Flowers ( 5 - 15 petals)
- Stars (5 & 11 points)
- Fluffy Clouds
- Circles
- Squares 
- Nautili (nautiluses are NOT A LIE) 
- Triangles
- Pentagons (defense headquarters)
- Hexagons (6 sides)
- Octagons (8 sides)
- Oddagons (random odd numbered sides) 
- Dexagons (10 sides)
- Randogons (random numbers of sides)
  
More shapes are planned to be added including blobs, flames, hearts, etc.

No UI yet (coming soon) but the granular config object allows fine adjustment of all parameters used in generating each shape.
